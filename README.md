# README

This is a simple Rust library that teaches you how to use third party
libraries in your code using the Cargo tool.

## Usage

This library exposes one public function. This function requires no arguments
and it simply prints `Hello world!` to the console.

Following is how to do it.

```rust
lib_hello_world::greet_hello_world();
```
